# CodeStock - Start Reacting

A presentation I gave at CodeStock 2015 on React and Flux.

### Warning!

There are code crimes in here.  In particular I'm abusing the router here to achieve my goal.  I'm sure there is a better way.  I would not use this as an example of a well structured react application.
