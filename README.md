# Webpack & React - Skeleton

This is just the basic skeleton that I use to create a new react apps.  I've included all of the things that I like:

* React
* Webpack
* Sass (see section below)
* React-Router
* Babel support
* Pushstate-server

and more!

## Getting started

To get started you just need to run the following:

    $ npm install
    $ webpack
    $ npm start

Running `npm start` will start webpack and the webpack hot reload server.

## Todo

* Create a better folder structure
* Add testing framework
* Choose a flux framework to include
* Convert to node-sass

## Sass loaders

We are currently using the ruby-sass-loader because it is more full featured
then the node-sass implementation.  Once the node-sass loader catches up we will
be moving to that.
